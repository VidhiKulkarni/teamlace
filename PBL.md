# PBL Web Project
## Project Description
Project Owner: Grace Wang (President of the GIDAS Club at DNHS)

This trimester we will be coding and deploying a website for the GIDAS club (Genes in Diseases and Symptoms). In the club, they learn about computational biology, participate
in research competitions at MirCore, and learn about the fundamentals of computer science, biology, and statistics. They also conduct funding for disease research. 

We will be building various pages for the website such as the About page, Contact Us page, etc. We will discuss with our project owner about what else she wants to include in the website.
