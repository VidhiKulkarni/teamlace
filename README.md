## Project Description
Project Owner: Grace Wang (President of the GIDAS Club at DNHS)<br>
Contact Info: 

This trimester we will be coding and deploying a website for the GIDAS club (Genes in Diseases and Symptoms). In the club, they learn about computational biology, participate
in research competitions at MirCore, and learn about the fundamentals of computer science, biology, and statistics. They also conduct funding for disease research. 

We will be building various pages for the website such as the About page, Contact Us page, Join Page, Sign up Page, Login Page, etc. We will discuss with our project owner about what else she wants to include in the website.

1. Home Page - Image Carousel, basic description of club
2. About Page - Greater in-depth explanation of club and what they do
3. Team Page - Introduce the Club Leadership
4. Login Page - Club members and leaders can login to website
5. Upcoming Events and Calendar Page - Update on upcoming events and calendar for the events 
6. Donate - donate to the club
7. Registration Page - sign up with login information
